Hello World! 
I am Vanina Tonzo, an evolutionary biologist using genomic tools to answer weird questions.

I am working as a post-doctoral researcher in the Nosil Lab at the Center for Evolutionary and Functional Ecology (CEFE-CNRS) in Montpellier, France.

I am Argentine, although I come from a family of Italo-Basque immigrants. Although my training in science began in Argentina, at the University of Buenos Aires I have continued my training and my academic career in Europe.
Evolution is something that I am passionate about in biology, especially its study through the genomic lens, and without wanting to or even thinking about it, arthropods have been my study model. Of course I love them now!

As a PhD student, I have been trained in population genomics using ddRadseq as a tool to capture intra and inter specific variability and study evolutionary processes in high mountain grasshopper species that inhabit the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. 
During this period I became interested in adaptive processes, especially within a phylogenomic framework. What allows organisms to adapt to certain environments or conditions, what prompted these adaptations and when they took place, are questions that began to outline my future scientific path...

In my current project I try to uncover the processes of parallel adaptation to subterranean environments in spider species of the Troglohyphantes genus through a comparative genomics approach. 

A little bit more about me:
